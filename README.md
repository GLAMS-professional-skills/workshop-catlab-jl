# Computational Category Theory

## Open the project up in GitHub
In GitHub, click on the green "Code" button above, choose the "codespaces" tab instead of "local" and create a new Codespace on the main branch.
## Alternative (compose)
`docker`/`podman` compose can also be used instead to run locally

## Getting Started

Link to [Catlab](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/) documentation.

The main notebook is [working_file/notebook.ipynb](working_file/notebook.ipynb), run the cells there and make sure they show the graphs as required.
